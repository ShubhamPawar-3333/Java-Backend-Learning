# Comprehensive Notes on the Scanner Class in Java

## Introduction
The **Scanner** class in Java is a powerful and versatile utility provided in the `java.util` package. It is designed to parse input from various sources, such as the console (`System.in`), files, or strings, and convert it into usable data types like integers, doubles, or strings. This class is particularly popular in interactive console-based applications, enabling developers to capture and process user input efficiently. The Scanner class simplifies input handling by breaking down input into tokens using a delimiter (by default, whitespace) and providing methods to read these tokens as specific data types.

This document provides an in-depth exploration of the Scanner class, including its functionality, methods, practical examples, error handling, advanced use cases, and best practices, based on the content from the [Naukri Code360 article](https://www.naukri.com/code360/library/scanner-class-in-java).

## Importing the Scanner Class
To use the Scanner class, you must import it from the `java.util` package:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

## Creating a Scanner Object
A Scanner object is initialized by specifying the input source. The most common source is `System.in` for console input:
```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```
Other sources include:
- **File**: `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("input.txt"));`
- **String**: `Scanner scanner = new Scanner("Hello 123");`

Always close the Scanner to prevent resource leaks:
```java
scanner.close();
```

## Core Methods of the Scanner Class
The Scanner class provides a variety of methods to read different data types and control input parsing. Below is a detailed table of commonly used methods:

| Method | Description | Example Usage |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `next()` | Reads the next token as a String (up to the next delimiter). | `String word = scanner.next();` |
| `nextLine()` | Reads an entire line of input as a String, including spaces, until a newline. | `String line = scanner.nextLine();` |
| `nextInt()` | Reads the next token as an integer. Throws `InputMismatchException` if invalid. | `int num = scanner.nextInt();` |
| `nextDouble()` | Reads the next token as a double. Throws `InputMismatchException` if invalid. | `double value = scanner.nextDouble();` |
| `nextFloat()` | Reads the next token as a float. Throws `InputMismatchException` if invalid. | `float value = scanner.nextFloat();` |
| `nextLong()` | Reads the next token as a long. Throws `InputMismatchException` if invalid. | `long value = scanner.nextLong();` |
| `nextBoolean()` | Reads the next token as a boolean (`true` or `false`). Throws `InputMismatchException` if invalid. | `boolean flag = scanner.nextBoolean();` |
| `hasNext()` | Returns `true` if there is another token available. | `if (scanner.hasNext()) { ... }` |
| `hasNextInt()` | Returns `true` if the next token can be parsed as an integer. | `if (scanner.hasNextInt()) { ... }` |
| `hasNextDouble()` | Returns `true` if the next token can be parsed as a double. | `if (scanner.hasNextDouble()) { ... }` |
| `useDelimiter(String pattern)` | Sets a custom delimiter for tokenizing input. | `scanner.useDelimiter(",");` |
| `skip(String pattern)` | Skips input that matches the specified pattern. | `scanner.skip("\\s*");` |

## Basic Example: Reading User Input
Below is a simple program demonstrating how to use the Scanner class to read a user's name and age from the console:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BasicScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Please enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        
        System.out.print("Please enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.");
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
**Sample Output**:
```
Please enter your name: Alice Smith
Please enter your age: 30
Hello, Alice Smith! You are 30 years old.
```

## Handling the Newline Issue
When using methods like `nextInt()` or `nextDouble()`, the Scanner reads the number but leaves the newline character (`\n`) in the input buffer. If you call `nextLine()` afterward, it may read this leftover newline instead of the next input line. To avoid this, consume the newline by calling `scanner.nextLine()`:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewlineIssueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume the leftover newline
        
        System.out.print("Enter a sentence: ");
        String sentence = scanner.nextLine();
        
        System.out.println("Number: " + number);
        System.out.println("Sentence: " + sentence);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
**Sample Output**:
```
Enter a number: 42
Enter a sentence: This is a test
Number: 42
Sentence: This is a test
```

## Exception Handling
The Scanner class can throw exceptions if the input doesn't match the expected type or if no input is available. Key exceptions include:
- **InputMismatchException**: Occurs when the input cannot be parsed into the requested type (e.g., entering "abc" for `nextInt()`).
- **NoSuchElementException**: Occurs when attempting to read beyond the available input.
- **IllegalStateException**: Occurs if the Scanner is closed and a read operation is attempted.

Example with exception handling:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.InputMismatchException;

public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        try {
            System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
            int number = scanner.nextInt();
            System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Please enter a valid integer.");
        } finally {
            scanner.close();
        }
    }
}
```
**Sample Output (Invalid Input)**:
```
Enter an integer: abc
Error: Please enter a valid integer.
```

## Reading Input from a File
The Scanner class can read from a file by passing a `File` object to its constructor. This is useful for processing text files:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FileInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("input.txt");
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);
            
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                String line = scanner.nextLine();
                System.out.println("Read from file: " + line);
            }
            
            scanner.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
**Sample input.txt**:
```
Line 1: Hello World
Line 2: Java Programming
```
**Sample Output**:
```
Read from file: Line 1: Hello World
Read from file: Line 2: Java Programming
```

## Custom Delimiters
By default, Scanner uses whitespace as a delimiter. You can customize this using `useDelimiter()`:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CustomDelimiterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "apple,banana,orange";
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(input);
        scanner.useDelimiter(",");
        
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println("Fruit: " + scanner.next());
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
**Output**:
```
Fruit: apple
Fruit: banana
Fruit: orange
```

## Advanced Example: Parsing Mixed Input
This example demonstrates reading mixed data types and handling potential errors:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.InputMismatchException;

public class MixedInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        try {
            System.out.print("Enter your ID (integer): ");
            if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
                int id = scanner.nextInt();
                scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline
                
                System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
                String name = scanner.nextLine();
                
                System.out.print("Enter your GPA (double): ");
                if (scanner.hasNextDouble()) {
                    double gpa = scanner.nextDouble();
                    System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", GPA: " + gpa);
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Error: Invalid GPA format.");
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("Error: Invalid ID format.");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("An unexpected error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            scanner.close();
        }
    }
}
```
**Sample Output**:
```
Enter your ID (integer): 123
Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your GPA (double): 3.85
ID: 123, Name: John Doe, GPA: 3.85
```

## Best Practices
1. **Close the Scanner**: Always close the Scanner using `scanner.close()` to release system resources, especially when using `System.in` or files.
2. **Validate Input**: Use `hasNextInt()`, `hasNextDouble()`, etc., to check input validity before reading to avoid `InputMismatchException`.
3. **Handle Newline Characters**: After reading numbers with `nextInt()` or similar, consume the newline with `scanner.nextLine()` if reading strings afterward.
4. **Exception Handling**: Wrap input operations in try-catch blocks to handle invalid input gracefully.
5. **Custom Delimiters**: Use `useDelimiter()` for parsing structured input like CSV data.
6. **Resource Management**: Avoid creating multiple Scanner objects for `System.in`, as closing one Scanner closes the underlying input stream, affecting others.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Newline Issue**: Failing to consume the newline after `nextInt()` or similar methods can cause unexpected behavior when reading strings.
- **Scanner Closure with System.in**: Closing a Scanner tied to `System.in` prevents further console input in the program, as `System.in` cannot be reopened.
- **Invalid Input**: Not validating input types can lead to exceptions that crash the program.
- **File Handling**: Forgetting to handle `FileNotFoundException` when reading from files can cause errors.

## Conclusion
The Scanner class is an essential tool for handling input in Java, offering flexibility to read from various sources and parse data into different types. By understanding its methods, handling exceptions, and following best practices, developers can create robust and user-friendly applications. This class is particularly valuable for beginners learning Java and for advanced developers working with file-based or structured input.
